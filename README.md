# Pascal Practice Repository

Welcome to the Pascal Practice Repository! 

In this repository, you will find a collection of practices and exercises in Pascal, focusing on low-level data structures such as binary trees, linked lists, and more. Additionally, this repository includes examples of common programming practices like recursion, modularization, and others.

All of this work was completed during my first year at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP) in the Systems Analyst program.

## Contents

- **Binary Trees**: Implementation and manipulation of binary trees.
- **Linked Lists**: Examples and exercises on linked list data structures.
- **Recursion**: Demonstrations of recursive algorithms and techniques.
- **Modularization**: Examples of modular programming practices.
- **Other Data Structures**: Additional low-level data structures and their implementations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, you need to have a Pascal compiler installed on your machine. Simply clone the repository and compile the Pascal source files with your compiler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
